# AVGEngineV2_Tool  

The tool is a galgame engine unpack/pack tool for AVGEngine V2 (and GxEngine V3)  
GxEngine V3 archive format same as AVGEngine V2, but I can't guarantee full compatibility  
In fact,only one SLG (シロウト家出娘と俺) uses this engine for all i know
So,compatibility can't be fully guaranteed  
The engine's script file is called moacode.mwb, but the format of the old version (V1.0) differs from later versions  
The tool only extracts scenarios from the old version, for example, games like `えれくと！` and `あおぞらストライプ`
